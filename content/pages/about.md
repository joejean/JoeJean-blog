My name is Joe Jean. I created this blog mainly to share tips, tricks, new techniques and news about technology in general and computer programming in particular. 
Therefore, if you are a fan of those fields or you are just curious, this is definitely the right place for you.


### Who are you to write about technology? 

I have been in love with computers since the first time I was introduced to them: I was 14 years old. The more I use this powerful tool the more I love it 
and the more my eagerness to learn more about it. During the past few years, I have acquired some experience working in different branches of the computer industry:
from desktop support, to web development, application programming and telecom network operations. Furthermore, in addition to various training and seminars 
that I have attended, I studied Computer Science at <a href="http://www.uopeople.org" target="_blank">University of the People</a> for almost two years. Thanks
to my academic achievements there, I was offered the opportunity to apply to <a href="http://www.nyuad.nyu.edu" target="_blank">New York University in Abu Dhabi</a>
where I'm currently studying for my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Economics.
Among other branches of Computer Science, I'm really interested in Software Engineering and System Administration. And, yes, my favorite programming language is
**Python**!


### What are your core values?
As a Christian, I strive to honor God's name in everything I do. I value honesty, integrity, respect for others, love, hard work and positive thinking. 


### What are some of your hobbies? 
When I'm not writing codes or playing with a new technology, you can find me playing soccer or riding a bike.
I also love traveling the world!


### I have more questions for you, how do I contact you? 
Please just shoot me a message at **joe [at] joejean.info** and I will be glad to reply back as soon as possible. Or you can connect with me via the different social networks 
whose links are listed on the upper right part of the site. I hope to hear from you!
